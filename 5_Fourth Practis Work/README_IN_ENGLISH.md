Below are the instructions for the exercises that will be solved in this folder:

1. Write a procedure that stores in an array of records the data of 10 students, including their registration number (automatically generated every 100, starting with registration number = 1 to keep it ordered), name, last name, and grades for the 3 partial exams of a subject. Calculate the average for each student and display the list of students along with a message: "Promoted" if the student exceeds or equals the average of 7, "Regular" if it falls between 4 and 7, and "Fail" if the average is below 4.
Example:

The array could be:
{[1,"Juan", "Pérez", 5,7,8], [101,"Luis", "García", 2,8,8], [201,"Maria", "Alonso", 6,6,10],..., [901,"Alicia", "Rojas", 2,2,4]}

Result:
Registration Name Last Name Average Status
1 Juan Pérez 6.66 Regular
101 Luis García 6.00 Regular
201 Maria Alonso 7.33 Promoted
..........................................
901 Alicia Rojas 2.66 Fail

2. Create a program that stores in an array of records the following information for N workers: name, age, gender (F or M), marital status (S(single), C(married), D(divorced), and O(other)) and base salary. Calculate and display on the screen the number of male workers, the number of married female workers, the name of the youngest employee, and the sum of all salaries.
Example:
N= 4
Employees={[“Pérez Pablo”, 25,”M”,”C”,28000.00],
[“García Ismael”, 45,”M”,”D”,32500.00],
[“Sanchez Claudia”,38,”F”,”C”,30000.00],
[“Rodriguez Marisa”, 23,”F”,”S”,28000.00]}

Result:
Number of male workers= 2
Number of married female workers= 1
Youngest employee= Rodriguez Marisa
Total sum of salaries: $118500.00

3. In an elementary school, a class has a level, a teacher, and contains 20 students. Each student has a name, last name, a date of birth, and will have ten grades in the year. There are five classes. Provide the structures of the class and student records. Write an algorithm that shows for each class, the list of students and their ten associated grades.
