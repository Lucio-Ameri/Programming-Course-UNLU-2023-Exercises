Below are the instructions for the exercises that will be solved in this folder:

1. Create a function that receives two integers as parameters, performs the arithmetic sum of both, and returns the result of the sum.

2. Create a function that receives two integers as parameters, performs the arithmetic subtraction of both, and returns the result of the subtraction.

3. Create a function that receives two integers as parameters, performs the product of both, and returns the result of the product.

4. Create a function that receives two integers as parameters, calculates the result of the sum, the subtraction, and the product. The function should call the functions developed in the previous 3 items for its calculations. In case of successful completion, the function should return zero.


5. Create a function that receives a text as an argument and returns the number of letters in the text. Additionally, the function should display each word of the text on a new line.

6. Write a function that receives three character strings and displays the result of concatenating the first three letters of the strings on the screen. Additionally, the function should return zero if the first two strings are equal, two if the last two strings are equal, three if all the strings are equal, and four if all the strings are different.

7. Write a function that processes the grades of a student enrolled in Programming 1 for the two partial exams. The function receives the two grades and reports the student's situation along with their average grade on the screen. Additionally, the function should return the average grade of the student. The rules to determine a student's situation are as follows:
   • To be promoted (i.e., passed the course and does not need to take the final exam), the student must have passed both partial exams and have an average grade greater than or equal to 7.
   • To be regular (passed the course but needs to take the final exam), the student must have passed both partial exams (grade greater than or equal to 4).
   • If the student has not passed both partial exams (i.e., has a grade less than 4 in either of them), then they are in the condition of being free (i.e., can take an extended final or retake the course).

8. Write a main program that calls the previous function for a class of n students enrolled in the course and displays the average grade of the class on the screen. The grades of the students in the partial exams should be random integers between 0 and 10 generated in the main program.

9. Create a function that receives the type of pump for a machine, where the pump type is an integer value between 0 and 4. According to the pump type, the following message should be displayed using a switch statement:
   • If the pump type is 0, display a message on the console indicating "No defined value for the pump type."
   • If the pump type is 1, display a message on the console indicating "The pump is a water pump."
   • If the pump type is 2, display a message on the console indicating "The pump is a gasoline pump."
   • If the pump type is 3, display a message on the console indicating "The pump is a concrete pump."
   • If the pump type is 4, display a message on the console indicating "The pump is a food paste pump."
   • If none of the above values are met, display the message "There is no valid value for the pump type."

10. Write a program that calls the previous function in an infinite loop with a random integer between 0 and 10. The loop should end when the random integer is 9.
