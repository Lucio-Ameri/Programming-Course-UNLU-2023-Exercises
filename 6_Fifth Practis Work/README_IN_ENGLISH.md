Below are the instructions for the exercises that will be solved in this folder:

1. Create a program that, through a function, sorts an array of 20 elements. This function will receive two parameters: the first indicating the array to be sorted, and the second indicating whether the order will be "A" - Ascending (from smallest to largest) or "D" Descending (from largest to smallest).
Example:
If the array is ={5, 7, 3, 9, 2, 3, 4,14,..., 12 }, and the order is "A"
sort_array(array, order) = {2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9,...,12, 14 }

2. Write a function that receives a sorted array and an element x. If the element x is in the array, it should find its position using binary search and return the position. If it is not found, it should add x to the array in the correct position and return that new position.

3. Write a function that receives two arrays of n elements, Registration (n) and Grade (n), returns the arrays sorted in ascending order while preserving the relationship, and displays the sorted list on the screen.

Example:
n= 4
REGISTRATION= {564, 1545, 685, 1236}
GRADE= {4, 5, 10, 9}

Returns:
REGISTRATION = {564, 685, 1236, 1545}
GRADE = { 4, 10, 9, 5}

Display on the screen:
REGISTRATION GRADE
564 4
685 10
1236 9
1545 5

4. Using exercise 3 from TP5, make the necessary modifications so that the list of students is always sorted alphabetically.

5. Using exercise 1 from TP5, make the necessary modifications to obtain a list sorted by averages from highest to lowest.
